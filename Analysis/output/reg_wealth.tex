Results from median regressions, a particular instance of the median regression, using data from the 1999-2019 PSID. The sample includes household head (men or women) who experienced a divorce or a breakup in the two years before the interview. We regress their individual net worth after the breakup on the couple's net worth before the breakup. Net worth and income are expressed in 1997 10,000 dollars. Coefficients that are significantly different from zero are denoted by *10\%, **5\%, and ***1\%.
