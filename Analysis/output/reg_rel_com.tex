Notes: This table reports the average effect of unilateral divorce on the choice between cohabitation and marriage. The analysis follows the methodology outlined in \cite{borusyak2021} uses and the \textit{relationships sample}. The unit of observation refers to newly formed couples (either married or cohabiting) in state \textit{s} and year \textit{t}. The dummy variable \textit{Unilateral Divorce} takes the value 1 if unilateral divorce was in effect in state \textit{s} and year \textit{t} and 0 otherwise. The additional controls include dummies for ethnicity, age, and education. ComP: community property states; Tit: title based regime. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. Coefficients that are significantly different from zero are denoted by *10\%, **5\%, and ***1\%.
