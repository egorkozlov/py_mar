Notes: This table reports the average effect of unilateral divorce on the probability of cohabitation ending in a marriage. The analysis follows the methodology outlined in \cite{borusyak2021} uses and the \textit{cohabitations sample}. The unit of observation is one cohabitation-month, which corresponds to a specific month within a particular cohabitation spell. The focus of this table is to report the probability of a cohabitation spell (initiated in state \textit{s} and year \textit{t}) ending in a marriage, with the occurrence of breakup considered as a termination point (right censoring) for the cohabitation period. The dummy variable \textit{Unilateral Divorce} takes value 1 if unilateral divorce was in effect in state \textit{s} and year \textit{t} at the start of the cohabitation spell. The additional controls include dummies for ethnicity, age, education, duration of cohabitation, and the introduction of unilateral divorce \textit{after} the cohabitation period commenced. ComP: community property states; Tit: title based regime. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. Coefficients that are significantly different from zero are denoted by *10\%, **5\%, and ***1\%.
