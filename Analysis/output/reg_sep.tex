Notes: This table reports the average effect of unilateral divorce on the probability of cohabitation ending in a breakup vs. marriage. The analysis follows the methodology outlined in \cite{borusyak2021} uses and the \textit{cohabitations sample}. The unit of observation is the end of a cohabitation spell (either marriage or breakup) which \textit{started} in state \textit{s} and year \textit{t}. The dummy variable \textit{Unilateral Divorce} takes value 1 if unilateral divorce was in effect in state \textit{s} and year \textit{t}. The additional controls include dummies for ethnicity, age, and education. The sample associated to regressions including State-specific linear time trend excludes five states due to multicollinearity. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. Coefficients that are significantly different from zero are denoted by *10\%, **5\%, and ***1\%.
